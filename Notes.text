## Overview
This project is a **Java-based web scraper** that extracts data about Alaska State Senators from the official [AKLeg.gov Senate Page](https://akleg.gov/senate.php).  
It demonstrates how to use **Playwright for Java** to perform automated browsing, DOM extraction, and JSON export.

---

## Features
- Uses **Microsoft Playwright** to load and parse web content dynamically.
- Extracts details such as:
  - Senator Name  
  - Title  
  - Party  
  - Contact URL
- Exports all scraped data into a **formatted JSON file** (`senators.json`).
- Implements **GSON** for structured data serialization.
